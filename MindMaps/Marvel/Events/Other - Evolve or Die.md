# Other - Evolve or Die
## Description: Just as Spider-Man discovers he's dying from a mysterious disease, Morlun seemingly returns from the dead. Morlun attacks Spider-Man, with the intention of absorbing his essence. But when Morlun threatens Mary Jane, Spider-Man savagely protects her, biting Morlun and absorbing his essence, killing him. Spider-Man dies in Mary Jane's arms and his body is taken to Stark Tower, where something emerges from the body and forms a cocoon from which a revitalized Peter Parker soon breaks free with newfound powers.
