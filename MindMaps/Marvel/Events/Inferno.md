# Inferno
## Description: The demon-sorcerer N'astirh not only wished to rule Limbo, but Earth as well. He conceived of a plot to kidnap 13 human babies in order to sacrifice them in a ritual known as Inferno. Using the babies' energy, he opened a portal between Limbo and Earth, which grew unnaturally hot and people began to succumb to their evil desires. Inferno had begun.
