# Inhumans (1975 - 1977)
## Description: Come along and join Black Bolt, Medusa, Triton, Gorgon, Karnak and loveable Lockjaw, as they struggle in battle against both Kree and Skrull in The War of the Three Galaxies! It all begins when Blastaar bursts into the Inhumans' Himalayan refuge to activate an ancient menace designed to devour the entire Inhuman race. That Kree monster is just the first salvo in a war that will lead the Royal Family to the stars and into battle side by side with Captain Marvel. And if cosmos-spanning war isn't enough to keep Black Bolt and company busy, the insane Maximus can always be relied upon to wreak havoc - and then only to whet the appetite for the coming of the Incredible Hulk!
