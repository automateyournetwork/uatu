# The Punisher: Year One (1994 - 1995)
## Description: We've known for years about the deaths of Frank Castle's wife and children, but now we see Castle himself mere hours later, when his grief and rage were at their freshest. To the police, he's a lead. To a reporter, he's a story. To the mob, he's just one more loose end. Relive the brutal origin of the Punisher, told in vivid detail by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning and Dale Eaglesham!
