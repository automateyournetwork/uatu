# Star Wars: War of the Bounty Hunters (2021 - Present)
## Description:  Never betray a bounty hunter — especially if it’s Boba Fett! Years ago, Valance and Bossk joined Fett on a mission that went sideways in a bad way — thanks to a violent betrayal by Valance’s mentor, Nakano Lash! The trio barely escaped with their lives. Now Lash has finally resurfaced under mysterious circumstances, and every bounty hunter in the galaxy wants a piece. Valance is hell-bent on getting to the prize first — after all, he has a score to settle. But so does Boba Fett! What could have possibly made Lash break her word and betray her protégé? The truth could shake the foundations of the galaxy’s criminal underworld! The biggest, baddest bounty hunters of all clash in a rip-roaring tale of scum and villainy, Star Wars-style!
