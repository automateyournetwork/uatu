# Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade (2021 - Present)
## Description: THE GREATEST KNIGHT OF THEM ALL RIDES AGAIN! Dane Whitman is the BLACK KNIGHT and wielder of the magical EBONY BLADE, but the blade’s power comes at a terrible price. Dane forever bears the burden of its curse: an insatiable lust for blood and mayhem that constantly threatens to swallow its owner in darkness. Must that be Dane’s fate? Following the battle against the KING IN BLACK, a reinvigorated Dane has a greater sense of purpose than ever before. But his sword is the key to a new enemy’s evil plan and only the Black Knight can prevent the coming death and destruction. This conflict spanning mythical Camelot to modern-day NYC will test Dane like never before and challenge everything he believes about himself, the Ebony Blade, and the entire history of the Black Knight! Guest starring the AVENGERS!
