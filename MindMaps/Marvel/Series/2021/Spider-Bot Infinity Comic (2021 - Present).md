# Spider-Bot Infinity Comic (2021 - Present)
## Description: For most of his crime-fighting career, the one and only Amazing Spider-Man has worked on his own—but some jobs are too big even for a wall-crawling, web-slinging wonder like Spidey to handle by himself! Luckily, he’s got a team of technological wonders called the SPIDER-BOTS, who’re equipped with some of the most cutting-edge tech this side of Avengers Tower (and GREAT battery life) and by his side, ready to stop trouble in its tracks across the Marvel Universe!
