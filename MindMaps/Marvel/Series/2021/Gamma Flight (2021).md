# Gamma Flight (2021)
## Description: SPINNING OUT OF IMMORTAL HULK, BRUCE BANNER'S GAMMA-POWERED ALLIES GO ON THE RUN! Gamma Flight had one job: Find and stop the Hulk. But when push came to smash, they sided with the Green Goliath—and the human world intends to make them regret it. Puck, Absorbing Man, Titania, Doc Sasquatch, Dr. Charlene McGowan and a horribly changed Rick Jones are fugitives from every known authority—but a team that full of gamma is bound to break before long. Al Ewing, Crystal Frasier and Lan Medina mastermind a whole new world of gamma!
