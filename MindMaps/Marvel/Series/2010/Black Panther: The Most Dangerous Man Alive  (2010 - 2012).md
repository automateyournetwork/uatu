# Black Panther: The Most Dangerous Man Alive  (2010 - 2012)
## Description: There's a new protector of Hell's Kitchen! He has no kingdom, no vibranium, and no high-tech safety net--just bloody knuckles and the will to prove himself in a foreign land where the fiercest of jungle predators stalks the most dangerous urban prey! His name is T'Challa, and in the aftermath of Shadowland, he'll create a new life, a new identity, and learn what it is to be a different kind of hero. Be there as Edgar Award Winner David Liss & the pulp master Francesco Fracavilla begin a shocking new chapter for the world's most dangerous man!
