# Moon Knight (2006 - 2009)
## Description: It's hard to pin down who Moon Knight truly is. Sometimes he's the enormously wealthy, somewhat crazy Marc Spector. Others he's the brutally violent vigilante who follows the will of Khonshu, God of Vengeance. Even more personalities may dwell within his schizophrenic psyche, but thankfully, the madness helps make Moon Knight one of the grittiest, most engaging and unpredictable titles in the Marvel line-up.
