# Cable (2008 - 2010)
## Description: Cable's the son of original X-Man Scott Summers and the clone of Jean Grey who grew up in a war-torn future ruled by Apocalypse. Traveling back and forth through time, Cable recently traveled back to the future with a special purpose: Protect a mutant baby who could be mutantkind's savior. Like a sci fi Lone Wolf & Cub, the new Cable series is packed with action, adventure, humor and everything else an X-Men fan could ask for.
