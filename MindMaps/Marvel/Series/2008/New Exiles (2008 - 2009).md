# New Exiles (2008 - 2009)
## Description: While most heroes struggle to contain threats isolated to one city, the New Exiles jump from universe to universe to protect the fate and future of the Omniverse.  This is one book where you'll never expect where-or who-comes next! Looking for something a little different, from alternate universes to world-destroying events, New Exiles is right up your alley.
