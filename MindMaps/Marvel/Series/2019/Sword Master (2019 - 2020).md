# Sword Master (2019 - 2020)
## Description: Mounting threats and mysterious origins! You saw him tear through Fire Goblins in WAR OF THE REALMS with his magic sword! Now learn the origin of Lin Lie — A.K.A. Sword Master, Marvel's newest Chinese super hero — in the English-language debut of his original series! Haunted by dreams of demons, Lin Lie hunts for his missing archaeologist father, battles a threat from beyond — and awakens his black blade for the first time! But will the weapon prove more bloodthirsty than the demons he fights? Threats mount across the eras as Sword Master faces a mysterious warrior woman in our time — and the horrifying Chiyou, god of war, in the far past! But his greatest foe of all may be the sorcerer Baron Mordo! And when Mordo hits the scene, can Doctor Strange be far behind?
