# Scream: Curse of Carnage (2019)
## Description: Out of ABSOLUTE CARNAGE comes a new symbiotic sensation — and it'll be a Scream! Patricia Robertson, Andi Benton, Donna Diego — their stories have all been leading to this. Now one of Venom's original offspring — and quite possibly the strongest — stars at last in her own adventure! But in the wake of Carnage's assault, what remains of the Scream symbiote? Who is its host? What are its intentions? And what will a pair of web-slinging wall-crawlers have to say about Scream's presence in New York? Meanwhile, a darkness has formed in the waters surrounding the Big Apple — something evil that beckons Scream with a siren song! With Venom nowhere to be found, this is now her problem — but what is its connection to Knull, god of the symbiotes?
