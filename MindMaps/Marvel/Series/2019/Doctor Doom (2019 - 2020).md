# Doctor Doom (2019 - 2020)
## Description: Victor Von Doom is at a crossroads. Wrestling with visions of an entirely different life — a better future — the lord of Latveria offers mankind a stark warning about the folly of a trillion-dollar global effort to create the first artificial black hole. But when a catastrophic act of terrorism kills thousands, the prime suspect is…Doom! Left with no homeland, no armies, no allies — indeed, nothing at all — will Doctor Doom's reign come to an abrupt end? Forced to seek out an old "frenemy" for help, Victor will go through hell — literally! And his old foe Mephisto is waiting for him there! Doom will have to battle Taskmaster, M.O.D.O.K., the Blue Marvel and more — but can he clear his accursed name?
