# X-Factor (2005 - 2013)
## Description: X-Factor is quite possibly the most unpredictable book in the Marvel line-up. A psychological tour de force that doesn't skimp on the laughs, action or mystery, each issue of X-Factor brings something new to the table. Maybe not the best bet for a young reader, but a killer title for serious readers.
