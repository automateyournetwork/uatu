## Description: After the shocking end to the previous group known as X-Force, the mutant known as Psylocke recruits her own clandestine group of operatives-Storm, Puck and Spiral-for missions so important-and so bloody-no one can know the truth. But when the time traveler known as Bishop returns to the present, he puts this new X-Force in his sights and won't rest till he finds them. But just why does this former ally of the X-Men now hunt his former teammates? The answer will leave you speechless.
