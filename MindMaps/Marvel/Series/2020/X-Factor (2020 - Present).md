# X-Factor (2020 - Present)
## Description: Mutants have conquered death! By the grace of the Five, the resurrection protocols of the island nation of Krakoa can bring any of the X-Men's fallen comrades back to life. But such a huge enterprise comes with even bigger problems and complications! And when a mutant dies, X-Factor is there to investigate how and why — in order to uphold the rules of reincarnation! Writer Leah Williams and artists David Baldeón and Carlos Gómez take the all-new X-Factor — Northstar, Polaris, Prodigy, Eye-Boy, Daken and Prestige — deep into a murky world of murder and missing persons. But the team's first case might be its last as they investigate the disappearance of a mutant dancer at a prestigious ballet academy...in the Mojoverse! Be there as X-Factor explores the thin veil between life and death!
