# Amazing Spider-Man: The Daily Bugle (2020)
## Description: SPINNING OUT OF AMAZING SPIDER-MAN! The journalist must speak truth to power—whether or not it’s wielded responsibly. Helmed by Peter Parker’s mentor, Robbie Robertson, the Daily Bugle staff is at last chasing stories that matter. And in a city under Mayor Wilson Fisk, keeping the public informed is as essential as it is dangerous. Weaving between events in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL, Mat Johnson (Hellblazer Special: Papa Midnite, Incognegro, Loving Day) and Mack Chater (BLACK PANTHER AND THE CREW, Briggs Land) are following a lead into Kingpin and Spider-Man’s past that will change the way you look at the webslinger now, and as his story continues.
