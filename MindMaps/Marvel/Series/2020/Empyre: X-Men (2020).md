## Description: Collects Empyre: X-Men (2020) #1-4. Alien plants vs. mutant zombies! Plant people from outer space have come to Earth as part of the cosmic events of EMPYRE — but wouldn't you know it, they happen to arrive just as millions of deceased mutants rise from the grave as undead creatures hungry for human flesh! What are the odds? And can even the X-Men handle two simultaneous crises? Aliens! Plant-men! Mutants! Zombies! Demons! Explosions! This one has it all — and then some! The X-Men return to the graveyard island of Genosha in a tale so crazy, it took the entire writing crew of the Dawn of X line to tackle it!
