# Ultimate Spider-Man (USM)
## Description: For the past year, Peter Parker has been saving New York City from villains as the masked hero, Spider-Man. Facing thugs and evil geniuses alike, he learns how to balance heroics with homework and friends. Despite being a Super Hero, Peter is very much an average 16-year-old.  With the added responsibilities of being Spider-Man, juggling all the aspects of his life will continually challenge him.                                                                 

When S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, Nick Fury, offers Peter the chance to raise his game and become THE ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN, Midtown High becomes a secret operations base for Spider-Man and other young heroes under the watchful eye of Fury and the schoolâ€™s new principal, Agent Coulson.
