# Falcon/Sam Wilson (MAA)
## Description: Recruited from S.H.I.E.L.D. by his hero and mentor Tony Stark, Falcon is the Avengers' newest and youngest recruit. Like Tony, Sam is a genius with machines and technology. What he lacks in experience, Sam makes up in enthusiasm and determination. Falcon's suit of armor comes fully stocked with holographic wings, explosive flechettes, and retractable talons.
