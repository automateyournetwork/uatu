# Shard
## Description: Shard and her older brother Bishop were raised in the 21st Century, some eighty years into an alternate future, by their grandmother, in a timeline in which the X-Men were betrayed by one of their own and killed, causing a disaster that caused the government to place a stylized 'M' tattoo over the left eyes of all mutants.
