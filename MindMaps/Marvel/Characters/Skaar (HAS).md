# Skaar (HAS)
## Description: No one knows where Skaar, the savage sword-swinger, came from, but one thing is for sure...he's a Hulk. The intensity of Skaarâ€™s war cry "Skaar Slash!" is matched only by his ferocious appetite. Although he is a great asset in the fight against evil, Skaar is just as destructive at home as he is on the battlefield.
