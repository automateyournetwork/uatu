# Iron Fist (USM)
## Description: Danny is always focused yet relaxed - more Zen-focused than chill surfer dude. But when Danny turns into Iron First, he becomes very rigid with perfect posture. A very Yin/Yang character. 

Danny is THE Danny Rand â€“ the 17-year-old head of the giant Rand Corporation.  His wealth rivals Osbornâ€™s â€“ but youâ€™d never know it from his laid- back attitude. However, as Iron Fist, he takes his powers very seriously. 

While Danny and Luke are best friends, Danny has a special respect for Spider-Man, acting as a non-judgmental moral commentator on all of Spider-Manâ€™s actions.
