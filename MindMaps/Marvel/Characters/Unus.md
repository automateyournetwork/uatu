# Unus
## Description: Angelo Unuscione is a mutant whose powers did not surface until adolescence, when he first used them as a school bully and later as a small time criminal before immigrating to America and using his ability to create a virtually impenetrable force field around himself to launch a career as a flamboyant, invincible costumed wrestler known by the stage name of Unus the Untouchable.
