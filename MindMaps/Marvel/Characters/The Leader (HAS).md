# The Leader (HAS)
## Description: What the Hulk has in strength, the Leader has in brains. Hulk's arch nemesis was affected by the same Gamma radiation that transformed Bruce Banner; but, instead of Hulk-ified muscles, the Leader got a Hulk-ified head. He's smart, sinister, and obsessed with destroying the Hulk!
