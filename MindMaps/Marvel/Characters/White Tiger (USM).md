# White Tiger (USM)
## Description: White Tiger takes everything very seriously. A constant overachiever, she wants to be better and wants the group to be better. With less flashy powers, she feels like she has to work the hardest. 
 
A skilled acrobatic fighter with feline senses and claws. Ava wears a small Tiger amulet on her belt that gives her supernatural powers.

In the field, sheâ€™s constantly frustrated with Spider-Man and his irreverent attitude. But the longer the two fight side by side, the more they will understand one another.
